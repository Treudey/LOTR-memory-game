# LOTR-memory-game
A LOTR-themed memory game built with React. 

The application renders different LOTR character images to the screen. The user's score is tracked and increased every time an image is clicked for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. Every time an image is clicked, the images shuffle themselves in a random order. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts. The user's high score is tracked the entire time they are on the site.
